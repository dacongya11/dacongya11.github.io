I am a postdoctoral researcher at Southwestern Institute of Physics in Chengdu, China. I am interested in turbulence, transport and self-organization in magnetized plasmas, geophysical fluids, and non-equilibrium systems in general. 

## Research Interests

* Turbulence and flows in magnetized plasmas
* Synchronization and pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems
* Reactivity and stability of complex dynamical systems
* Non-Hermitian physics in fluids and plasmas: reciprocity, symmetry and topological properties

## Education
* Ph.D. in Plasma Physics, Peking University, 2022 \
Thesis Title: _Theory of nonlinear phase dynamics in drift wave-zonal flow system_ \
Supervisor: Prof. [Zhibin Guo](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/guozhibin/zh_CN/index.htm)
* B.S. in Physics, Peking University, 2016
